                    <p class="card-text">
                        Health insurance is a crucial financial tool that provides coverage for various medical expenses. It typically pays for medical consultations, hospital stays, surgical procedures, prescription drugs, and sometimes dental care. Having health insurance can significantly reduce the financial burden associated with healthcare costs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        There are several types of health insurance plans available, including individual plans, family plans, employer-sponsored plans, and government-sponsored plans like Medicare and Medicaid. Each type of plan offers different coverage options and costs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        One of the key benefits of health insurance is that it helps protect individuals and families from unexpected medical expenses. Without insurance, medical bills can quickly accumulate, leading to financial strain and even bankruptcy in some cases. Health insurance provides peace of mind, knowing that you are financially protected in case of illness or injury.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        It's important to carefully review and understand your health insurance policy, including coverage limits, deductibles, copayments, and exclusions. By understanding your policy, you can make informed decisions about your healthcare and avoid unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        In conclusion, health insurance is a valuable asset that offers financial protection and access to quality healthcare services. Whether you're an individual or a family, having health insurance is essential for maintaining your well-being and managing healthcare costs effectively.
